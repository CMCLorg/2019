Welcome to Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) 2018,
a workshop that provides a venue for work in computational
psycholinguistics: computational and mathematical modeling of linguistic
representation, development, and processing. We invite contributions that apply methods from computational linguistics to problems in the cognitive modeling of any and all natural language abilities. CMCL 2018 is co-located with the new [Society for Computation in Linguistics](http://blogs.umass.edu/scil/scil-2018/scil-2018-call-for-papers/) at the [2018 Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/event/lsa-2018-annual-meeting) in Salt Lake City.
