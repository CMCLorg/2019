LSA has now announced that CMCL 2018 (and SCiL) attendees are eligible for reduced registration for LSA. If you are not an LSA member, enter one of these codes during registration to get LSA member rates during registration:

SISTER2018STUDENT for students    
SISTER2018REGULAR for nonstudents

If you are already an LSA member, do not use the above codes. 

CMCL 2018 registration is automatic upon registration for [LSA 2018](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/event/lsa-2018-annual-meeting). Once you register for LSA, you will be able to attend LSA, CMCL, and [SCiL](http://blogs.umass.edu/scil/scil-2018/scil-2018-call-for-papers/).
