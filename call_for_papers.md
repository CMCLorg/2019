## Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL) 2018

## Workshop Description
This workshop provides a venue for work in computational psycholinguistics: the computational and mathematical modeling of linguistic generalization, development, and processing. We invite contributions that apply methods from computational linguistics to problems in the cognitive modeling of any and all natural language-related abilities. The 2018 workshop follows in the tradition of earlier CMCL meetings at ACL 2010, ACL 2011, NAACL-HLT 2012, ACL 2013, ACL 2014, NAACL 2015 and EACL 2017.

CMCL 2018 will be co-located with the new [Society for Computation in Linguistics](http://blogs.umass.edu/scil/scil-2018/scil-2018-call-for-papers/) at the [2018 Annual Meeting of the Linguistic Society of America](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/event/lsa-2018-annual-meeting) in Salt Lake City. Please do not submit the same work to both CMCL and SCiL or to both CMCL and LSA.

## Important Dates

* Submission deadline: 10 September 2017

* Numeric reviews due: 30 September 2017

* Final reviews due: 8 October 2017

* Notification of acceptance: 10 October 2017

* Camera-ready versions due: 10 November 2017

* Workshop: 7 January 2018

## Scope and Topics

The workshop invites a broad spectrum of work in the cognitive science of language, at all levels of analysis from sounds to discourse and on both learning and processing. We are interested in any papers that use NLP to model human behavior, that use behavioral corpora to evaluate NLP, or that conduct behavioral experiments to test the cognitive-plausibility of NLP model predictions. Topics include, but are not limited to: 

* Incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms
* Stochastic models of factors encouraging one production or interpretation over its competitors
* Models of cognitively-plausible semantic or pragmatic interpretation and/or composition
* Models of human language acquisition, including phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics
* Models of human language adaptation in a changing linguistic environment
* Quantitative measures of comprehension difficulty
* Models of generalization in language learning
* Development and evaluation of NLP systems using cognitive principles and measurements (e.g. plausibility of different artificial neural network architectures for human cognition)
* Models of linguistic information propagation and language change in communication networks
* Psychologically motivated models of grammar induction or semantic learning

Submissions are especially welcomed that combine computational modeling work with experimental or corpus data to test theoretical questions about the nature of human language acquisition, comprehension, and/or production.

## Submissions

 We solicit three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications. All submissions should be in PDF format submitted to our EasyChair page:

 [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcl2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cmcl2018)

 To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted manuscripts should not include any identifying information about the authors.

 Submissions are limited to 8 content pages (plus unlimited pages for references) and should follow the two-column ACL format. We strongly recommend the use of the official ACL 2017 style templates:

  LaTeX: [http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-latex.zip](http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-latex.zip)

  Microsoft Word: [http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-word.zip](http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-word.zip)

 If essentially identical papers are submitted to multiple conferences or workshops, this fact must be indicated at submission time. Please do not submit the same work to both CMCL and SCiL or to both LSA and SCiL - these meetings are being held jointly, and your submission will be returned without review.

 The submission deadline is 11:59PM Pacific Time on September 10, 2017.

### Regular Workshop Papers

 This call solicits full papers (8 content + unlimited bibliography pages) and short papers (4 content + unlimited bibliography pages) reporting original and unpublished research that combines cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings (previous inclusion in an abstract proceedings as for the CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing is acceptable).

#### Camera-Ready Format

 Papers accepted for inclusion in the CMCL proceedings can have up to 9 pages of content and unlimited pages for references. Since the proceedings will be published in the ACL anthology, camera-ready papers must adhere to the ACL LaTeX styles linked to above.

### Extended Abstracts
 Preliminary but interesting ideas or results that have not been published before may be submitted as extended abstracts, with length of 2 to 4 pages plus references, following the ACL 2017 formatting requirements. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized. Accepted abstracts will be presented as posters, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

### Cross-Submissions
 In addition to unpublished work, we also solicit papers on related topics that have appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g., papers at CogSci). These papers will be presented as posters, but do not count as CMCL workshop papers and will not be included in the proceedings.  Interested authors need to submit their papers in PDF format through the same EasyChair website and should [email](mailto://cmclworkshop2018@gmail.com) the organizers a note with the submission title and the original venue. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format and the selection is solely determined by the organizing committee.

## Best Student Paper
 The best regular workshop paper whose first author is a student will receive the Best Student Paper award.

## Student Travel Grants
 Thanks to the generosity of the Johns Hopkins University Department of Cognitive Science, CMCL is able to provide a small number of student travel awards ($200 each) for accepted, first-authored student papers this year. To be considered for a student travel grant, the student first author should [email](mailto://cmclworkshop2018@gmail.com) the organizers a request for consideration and a list of other funding sources available to the student.
