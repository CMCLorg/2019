Workshop Description
This workshop provides a venue for work in computational psycholinguistics: the computational and mathematical modeling of linguistic generalization, development, and processing. We invite contributions that apply methods from computational linguistics to problems in the cognitive modeling of any and all natural language-related abilities. The 2017 workshop follows in the tradition of earlier CMCL meetings at ACL 2010, ACL 2011, NAACL-HLT 2012, ACL 2013, ACL 2014, and NAACL 2015.

Scope and Topics
The workshop invites a broad spectrum of work in the cognitive science of language, at all levels of analysis from sounds to discourse and on both learning and processing. Topics include, but are not limited to: 

incremental parsers for diverse grammar formalisms
stochastic models of factors encouraging one production or interpretation over its competitors
models of semantic/pragmatic interpretation, including cognitively-plausible meaning and composition
models of human language acquisition, including phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics
models of human language adaptation in a changing linguistic environment
derivations of quantitative measures of comprehension difficulty, or predictions regarding generalization in language learning
application of cognitive models and measurements to the development and evaluation of NLP systems (e.g., cognitive plausibility of different artificial neural network architectures)
models of linguistic information propagation and language change in communication networks
psychologically motivated models of grammar induction or semantic learning
 Submissions are especially welcomed that combine computational modeling work with experimental or corpus data to test theoretical questions about the nature of human language acquisition, comprehension, and/or production.

 Submissions
 We solicit three categories of papers: regular workshop papers, extended abstracts and cross-submissions. Only regular workshop papers will be included in the proceedings as archival publications. All submissions should be in PDF format and made through the Softconf website: https://www.softconf.com/eacl2017/cmcl2017

 To facilitate double-blind reviewing, submitted manuscripts should not include any identifying information about the authors.

 Submissions must be formatted using ACL 2017 submission guidelines at: http://eacl2017.org/index.php/calls/call-for-papers

 Submission style templates are available at: http://eacl2017.org/images/site/eacl-2017-template.zip

 If essentially identical papers are submitted to multiple conferences or workshops, this fact must be indicated at submission time.

 The submission deadline is 11:59PM Pacific Time on January 16, 2017.

 Regular Workshop Papers
 This call solicits full papers (8 content + 2 bibliography pages) and short papers (4 content + 2 bibliography pages) reporting original and unpublished research that combines cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results. A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be presented or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings (previous inclusion in an abstract proceedings as for the CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing is acceptable).

 Extended Abstracts
 Preliminary but interesting ideas or results that have not been published before may be submitted as extended abstracts, with length of 2 to 4 pages plus references, following the ACL 2017 formatting requirements. Reviewing will be double-blind, and thus no author information should be included in the papers; self-reference that identifies the authors should be avoided or anonymized. Accepted abstracts will be presented as posters, but will not be included in the workshop proceedings.

 Cross-Submissions
 In addition to unpublished work, we also solicit papers on related topics that have appeared in a non-NLP venue (e.g., papers at CogSci). These papers will be presented as posters, but do not count as CMCL workshop papers and will not be included in the proceedings.  Interested authors need to submit their papers in PDF format through the same Softconf website with a note on the original venue. Papers in this category do not need to follow the ACL format and the selection is solely determined by the organizing committee.

 Invited Speakers
 We are pleased to welcome Raquel Fernández from the University of Amsterdam and Anders Søgaard from the University of Copenhagen as CMCL invited speakers in 2017.

 Best Student Paper
 The best regular workshop paper whose first author is a student will receive the Best Student Paper award.

 Student Travel Grants
 Thanks to the generosity of its sponsors, CMCL is able to provide a small number of student travel awards ($200 each) for accepted, first-authored student papers this year.
