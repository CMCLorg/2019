- <b>Emmanuele Chersoni</b>, Dep. of CBS, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University
  * Emmanuele is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. His main research interests include distributional semantic models, thematic fit modeling, automatic discovery of semantic relations and sentence processing.

- <b>Cassandra Jacobs</b>, Dep. of Psychology, University of Toronto
  * Cassandra studies the intersection between human memory and linguistic experience. She has used a mixture of Bayesian and neural network models trained on natural language corpora to simulate how people learn language, how they represent the meanings of words and multiword expressions, and how they remember what others say. She has particular expertise in predicting spoken language prosody and models of distributional semantics. She served as an organizer of the 2018 meeting of CMCL in Salt Lake City, and has organized symposia within the field of cognitive psychology on interdisciplinary questions in psycholinguistics.

- <b>Alessandro Lenci</b>, Dep. of Philology, Literature and Linguistics, University of Pisa
  * Alessandro Lenci, PhD, is Associate Professor in Linguistics at the University of Pisa, and the director of the Computational Linguistics Laboratory (CoLingLab) at the Dept. of Philology, Literature, and Linguistics. His main research areas are: distributional semantics and its applications in linguistic and cognitive research, computational lexical semantics, computational models of verb argument structure, event types and verb aspect, tools and resources for NLP. He has been co-chair for the Computational Models of Human Language Acquisition and Processing area at EMNLP 2013, and co-chair for the Semantic Processing, Distributional Semantics and Compositional Semantics are at COLING 2014. He has been co-organizer of the ACL Workshops on Cognitive Aspects of Computational Language Learning in 2016 and 2018, and of the COLING Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon in 2016. He is one of the local co-organizers of ACL 2019 in Florence.

- <b>Tal Linzen</b>, Dep. of Cognitive Science, Johns Hopkins University
  * Tal Linzen is an Assistant Professor of Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins University. He develops computational cognitive models of language. In addition to his work in psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience, he has studied the syntactic capabilities of contemporary artificial neural networks and the linguistic information encoded in word embeddings, in work that has appeared in TACL, EACL and CoNLL. He has recently co-organized BlackboxNLP, the workshop on Analyzing and interpreting neural networks for NLP, co-located with EMNLP 2018. Has also organized two editions of the workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics, co-located with EACL 2017 and with SCiL 2018.

- <b>Laurent Prévot</b>, Laboratoire Parole et Langage, Aix-Marseille University
  * Laurent Prévot is a professor in Language Sciences at Aix Marseille Université and the director of Laboratoire Parole et Langage and a junior member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF). His specialties are linguistics (in particular semantic and pragmatic questions) and Natural Language Processing, with a focus on the computational modeling of discourse and interaction phenomena in spontaneous conversations. He is the a Program Co-chair and Local Organizer of The 22nd Workshop on Semantics and Pragmatics of Dialogue (SEMDIAL) ; an organization committee member of TALN 2014 conference; former Program Manager for Humanities and Social Sciences, France-Taiwan Frontiers of Science and Co-organizer of Workshops Logics and Semantics of Natural Language from 2008 to 2010.

- <b>Enrico Santus</b>, CSAIL, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  * Enrico Santus is postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His current research is focused on Information Extraction and Question Answering. His previous research has investigated lexical distributional semantics, with attention to similarity and relation identification, as well as thematic fit estimation. He has been co-chair in ESSLLI 2016 and *SEM 2018, and he organized numerous shared tasks, including SemEval-2018 Task 9 on Hypernymy Discovery and the CogALex-V Shared Task on the Corpus-Based Identification of Semantic Relations.
